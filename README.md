# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is considered a deadly eye condition as it can cause loss of vision and blindness among people who are diabetic. The high blood sugar levels cause considerable damage to the blood vessels in the retina and these blood vessels in the eye begin to leak fluid causing the macula to swell or thicken, preventing blood from passing through. Sometimes, there is an abnormal growth of new blood vessels on the retina. Diabetic retinopathy, when it is not detected and treated at the right time might lead to blindness eventually. 
1.	 Provided with a large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions, we create an automated analysis system capable of assigning a score based on the scale of severity of diabetes.
2.	 Predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements in the dataset. Several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
